## About this project:
Lorem Ipsum

## Approach
1. Identify data sources and dependencies
2. Collect and clean trajectory data
3. Join 6 datasets on personal income, total volume of motor vehicle registration by state, motor vehicle's age by state, total volume of motor vehicle registration by brand, Population by state, Size by state in comparison to whole Australia.
4. Load data in MongoDB
5. Create Flask App and connect routes to MongoDB local host
6. Create charts and map using Javascript libraries
7. Customise html for final application
8. Visualise dashboard locally or in Heroku

Data is derived from Kaggle. Data spans 2016 till 2021. ***

- [ABS motor vehicles census](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/industry/tourism-and-transport/motor-vehicle-census-australia/31-jan-2021#data-download)

## **Limitations, Assumptions & Challenges:**
- Car registration can be transferred hence the data may not show the full picture of the increase in the new registeration holders
- Data does not distinguish car owners vs. car leases or individuals vs. companies
- Data has been adjusted to be an average based on population size with an exception of the total car sales per brands
- Vehicle registers and the average income dataset could be skewed and biased due to inclusion of data such as a person owning a car without income (i.e, students, dependant child with parental support)
- Due to covid, the supply chain has been impacted which caused the data to be skewed as secondhand carâ€™s price rose to similar level as firsthand
- Restricted timeframe to complete project 3*
